                                <p><b>Q1. -- What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not?</b><br>
                                A system is composed of regularly interacting or interdependent groups of activities/parts that form a whole.<br><br>

                                <b>Q2. -- For the 4 system definitions, you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case.</b><br>
                                Modularity - A system with multiple parts that can be arranged in a variety of setups. <br>
                                	Ex: Modular couch with separate parts that can be arranged to form different shapes. <br>
                                Decomposibility - Breaking down into smaller parts that serve the same purpose. <br>
                                	Ex: Splitting a ball of dough into two gives you two balls of dough<br>
                                Emergence - A group of parts exhibiting a behavior that would not be done on their own.<br>
                                	Ex: Clock gears moving when connecting but staying still if one is missing. <br>
                                Chaos Theory - The behavior/outcome of a system is reliant on the initial conditions.<br>
                                	Ex: The taste of a salad is reliant on the ingredients you put in. <br><br>

                                <b>Q3 -- Give us your definition of what Tessellation means and give an example you encountered, not mentioned in the reading.</b><br>
                                A repeating geometric shape that forms a pattern without interfering with other shapes. Pineapples demonstrate a tessellation on their repeating cells. <br><br>

                                <b>Q4 -- What is The difference between ideas of Modularity and Tesselation? What are the properties that are in opposition with each other?</b><br>
                                Tesselation relies on the pattern formed with units whereas modularity focuses on the functions of the units within a system. <br><br>

                                <b>Q5 -- What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic)</b><br>
                                Complexity is a type of chaos system that is able to display complex adaptive behavior and does not repeat the same behavior over time. Uniform is something that does end up repeating itself over time. <br><br>

                                <p><b>Q1. What are the differences between site specific art work and the idea of art interventions.</b><br>
                                Art intervention focuses in the interactions had with an artwork in it's environment. These usually involve performance art. They change the location in some way. Site-specific artwork is created to exist in a certian location. Site-specific artists tend to make use of the architecture and terrain of a spot. <br><br>

                                <b>Q2. What are the similarities and differences regarding the art work of Robert Irwin, Walter De Maria, Banksy, and Robert Mongomery?</b><br>
                                All of these artists utilize their spaces to aid their artwork. The messages that they spread with their installations vary.<br><br>

                                <b>Q3. What are the main characteristics that seperate something being any kind of art versus what all signs must share to be relevant or meaningful? This means ALL signs, from art signs to traffic signs, to signs even in our home.</b><br>
                                The text displayed on a sign is meant to be taken at face value. Interpreting a written message is much different compared to interpreting an image. Some signs have a visual symbol on it. These symbols must be simplified and widely recognizable, not allowing any room for abstraction. <br><br>

                                <b>Q4. What Kind of art, (not shown here), have you seen that was made in response to its location, its environment, a specific event or situation. Please elaborate on its description and provide images if possible.</b><br>
                                Do Ho Suh is a sculpture artist that makes breathtaking installations that take advantage of the given spaces. One artwork in particular titled <a href="https://whitney.org/exhibitions/do-ho-suh">95 Horatio Street</a> retells the history of the meat packing industry that used to exist in that area. The optical illusion of a railroad image going through the building imatates a tunnel that used to pass through that neighborhood. <br><br>

                                <b>Q5. In class exercise. (In class on October 18th)</b><br>
                                I would visit my local mall quite often. This mall is located across the street from my high school and I used to go there every day to work at the clothing shops or food spots. I worked at 7 different places in this mall, most of which closed down due to low foot traffic. I watched this mall go from being somewhat popular to nearly dead in a matter of 10 years. I want to make a sign aknowleding the downfall of this mall. <br><br>
